## More Information
I completed my PhD in Physiology at University of Oxford in UK. I am a research scientist and mainly use MRI to investigate neurobiological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, dyslexia, dyscalulcia). To deepen our understanding of these highly heritable disorders, I also investigate typical and atypical brain development in infants.
